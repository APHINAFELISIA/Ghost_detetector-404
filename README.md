# Ghost_detetector-404
A fake ghost scanner app that always detects a ghost... until you try to see it.  This project is a fun, spooky, and completely useless ghost detector built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every scan "detects" a ghost with a random mood like:  Ghost Mood Report: Watching memes. Do not disturb.
