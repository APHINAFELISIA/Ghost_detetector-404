# Ghost_detetector-404
A fake ghost scanner app that always detects a ghost... until you try to see it.  This project is a fun, spooky, and completely useless ghost detector built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every scan "detects" a ghost with a random mood like:  Ghost Mood Report: Watching memes. Do not disturb.

### Project Description
Ghost_Detector-404 is a hilariously spooky, 100% fake ghost scanner app made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every time you scan your surroundings, it always finds a ghost ‚Äî with a random mood like:

‚ÄúGhost Mood Report: Watching memes. Do not disturb.‚Äù

But just when you try to see it ‚Äî poof! ‚Äî the ghost disappears. üëªüí®
Built to entertain, confuse, and cause mild panic.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if ghosts were real‚Ä¶ and really into memes and chilling?
But how do you know if there's a ghost around you, quietly vibing in your room?



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Ghost_Detector-404 ‚Äì the world's most unreliable and dramatic ghost scanner.
Every scan guarantees a ghost (because why not?) and a mysterious ghost mood.
Wanna catch it? Sorry, it vanishes when you try to look. Too bad.
